The Gaming Room client was wanting code that would allow multiple instances to be played at once and independently and done in a way that would allow the user to access and play across
multiple different devices.

 I do believe that I did well in describing the inistial layout of what the client was wanting and was able to research into what would make it better than what was expected of them.

 I found that breaking down the requirements into segments had turn out to be a big help that when I went to write the code, I could divide up the work into stepping stones to allow 
 for a slow progression of the code.

 I would say I would probably revise the chart of each of the different systems OS all over again as I feel that I don't have the most of the expierence with some of them to provide
 actual input into it.

 By thinking through the needs of the client, I broke down the needs to use as goals ranging from easy to difficult to allow for the code to be developed slowly and on time. It's 
 important as the client would need to make sure to get what they are expecting and had asked for as to not have to redo the entire work from scratch and waste everyone's time.

 I would say the best way to approach designing software is to first get all the major key points of the project then going to make charts for it. Making the flow chart to get a idea
 of the flow, then making charts for the classes to minimize repeating code unneccessarily. I would continue to build upon these skills for future development plans.
